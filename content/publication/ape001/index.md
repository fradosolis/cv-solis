  This study presents a comprehensive engineering analysis to increase the operating capacity of the Midwest MG50 bulk loading spout from 1,800 to 2,000 TPH using advanced Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations. The work evaluates material flow behavior, wear patterns, structural stresses, and design constraints across five alternative cone geometries, identifying the optimal configuration that reduces peak impact forces by 33% and wear loads by 21%. The analysis confirms that the upgraded configuration maintains stable flow, avoids blockage risks, ensures structural integrity with adequate safety factors, and operates within motor and lifting system limits—validating a safe and efficient capacity increase.

summary: Validated a capacity upgrade of the MG50 spout to 2,000 TPH through optimized cone geometry and DEM-based performance analysis.
