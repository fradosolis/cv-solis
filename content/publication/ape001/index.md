abstract: >
  Optimization of the MIDWEST MG50 loading sleeve to increase capacity from 1800 to 2000 MTPH, including DEM-based flow analysis evaluating five geometric configurations, assessment of impact forces and wear patterns, verification of structural components (lifting lugs, lifting tube, pulley support), and confirmation of operational safety with a required power of 18 HP against the installed 20 HP.

summary: Symbolic and numerical dynamic modeling of a SCARA robot with ROS2 and MATLAB integration.
