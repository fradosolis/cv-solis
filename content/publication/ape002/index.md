abstract: |
  This study presents a complete hydrodynamic and hydrostatic evaluation of a floating pump barge designed to operate in low-energy freshwater environments. The analysis combines manual naval-architecture calculations with ANSYS AQWA simulations to validate buoyancy, trim, stability, and dynamic response under typical river and reservoir conditions. The work includes determination of displaced volume, centers of gravity and buoyancy, metacentric height, wave-induced motions, and overturning stability using 6-degree-of-freedom response analysis. Results confirm that the platform maintains positive stability, safe operating trim, and low pitch/yaw amplitudes within the expected wave-frequency range (<0.3 Hz). Both analytical and simulated results align with DNV, ABS, and ISO stability guidelines, validating the suitability of the barge for continuous operation.

summary: Hydrodynamic and stability assessment of a floating pump barge through manual naval-architecture calculations and ANSYS AQWA simulation, confirming safe operating conditions and compliance with international standards.
