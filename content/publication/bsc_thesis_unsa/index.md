abstract: >
  In the present research work, the design of a conveyor belt located in an area near the sea and with high seismic danger has been carried out, the work was divided into three parts: Mechanical design, structural design of the metal support and analysis of the flow of the material at the transfer points, under a conservative criterion, the costs involved in the manufacture and purchase of the structural elements, mechanical components and the coating were shown.
  The mechanical design includes the initial and iterative calculation of the main stresses, calculation of pulleys, selection of accessories and components necessary for an optimal operation of the conveyor belt.
  The structural design of the support of the conveyor belt includes the determination and allocation of loads in the structure through a calculation program, determination of load combinations under the LRFD design method, analysis of the support frame of the counterweight by gravity, the analysis of connections under the effect of critical combinations and determination of the protective coating against the effects of corrosion.
  For the flow analysis, the material properties and characteristics of the transfer points were determined, three cases were simulated for each point, for the simulation computational models of discrete elements were used, for the choice of the most optimal model factors such as distribution, impact, adaptability, cost, etc.

summary: >
  Design of a 420 TPH conveyor system for copper concentrate, including mechanical, structural, and chute flow design using FEA, with validation according to applicable  standards.
